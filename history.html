                As Babar recalls in his diary, he personally ordered the construction of a garden in Kabul, It was the
                tradition of Mughal princes to develop sites for recreation and pleasure during their lifetime and
                choose one of these as the last resting. Babar's will was to transfer his body to Kabul after his death
                and bury it in the garden of their choice, not to build a mansion above his shrine, and not to place a
                guard or successor on his shrine.
                Zahiruddin Mohammad Babar, the founder of the Gurganian Empire of India, died in India in 905 AH and his
                body was first buried in Agra, India. But he had instructed his family to take his grandfather to Kabul
                and bury him in Babar Garden. Ten years after his death, his Afghan wife's Mubarak Yusufzai, along with
                his son Homayoun, transported his remains to Kabul and buried them in the fourteenth row of what is now
                Babur Garden.

                At the entrance of Babar Garden is a beautiful caravanserai that has been recently renovated and you
                have to pass through this place to enter the main area of the garden, in the past, this caravanserai was
                a place for merchants to go and a place for the poor to live. At present, this caravanserai has become
                offices of the garden and the shops selling famous handcrafts of Afghanistan.
                About 1.3 million men and women have visiting the garden per year which most them are students and
                tourists. If we take this figure as a criterion, we can say that in the last ten years, more than six
                million people have visited Babur Garden. And also more than 118 big programs are have disposing in
                Babar historical garden. These programs include celebrations, exhibitions, conferences, weddings,
                workshops and other cultural events.

                The Queen’s Palace
                According to the Babar Garden Preservation Institute, Amir Abdul Rahman Khan built a large palace for
                his harem in the eastern corner of the garden, which was completed in his time. This palace is called
                Qasre Malika (The Queen’s Palace).
                The Queen's Palace is an example of a typical royal palace in the second half of the nineteenth century
                in Kabul.
                During the reign of Amir Habibollah Kalkani, this palace became the German embassy, and later the hotels
                were established there, and at one time it became a sanctuary as an arms depot. For the last time during
                the reign of Zahir Shah, the dormitory of Khoshhal Khan High School was moved there and many places were
                built for the students.
