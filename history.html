                The garden is thought to have been developed around 1528 AD (935 AH), when Babur gave orders for the
                construction of an "avenue garden" in Kabul, described in some detail in his memoirs, the Baburnama.

                It was the tradition of Mughal princes to develop sites for recreation and pleasure during their
                lifetime and choose one of these as the last resting place. The site continued to be of significance to
                Babur's successors; Jahangir made a pilgrimage to the site in 1607 AD (1016 AH), when he ordered that
                all gardens in Kabul be surrounded by walls, that a prayer platform be laid in front of Babur's grave,
                and an inscribed headstone placed at its head.[1] During the visit of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in
                1638 (1047 AH), a marble screen was erected around the tomb of Babur, and a mosque built on the terrace
                below. There are accounts from the time of the visit to the site of Shah Jahan in 1638 (1047 AH) of a
                stone water channel that ran between an avenue of trees from the terrace below the mosque, with pools at
                certain intervals.

                The original construction date of the gardens (Persian: باغ, romanized: bāġ) is unknown. When Babur
                captured Kabul in 1504 from the Arguns he re-developed the site and used it as a guest house for special
                occasions, especially during the summer seasons. Since Babur had such a high rank, he would have been
                buried in a site that befitted him. The garden where it is believed Babur requested to be buried in is
                known as Bagh-e Babur. Mughal rulers saw this site as significant and aided in further development of
                the site and other tombs in Kabul. In an article written by the Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme,[2]
                describes the marble screen built around tombs by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1638 with the following
                inscription:
